            <div>At Oxford Languages, we are committed to an evidence-based approach to creating dictionaries in order to provide the most accurate picture of a language.
 
Our dictionaries are based on analysis of genuine uses of words collected from real-life sources to determine a word’s definition, spelling, and grammatical behaviour, and to offer guidance on a word’s use based on this research.
 
This evidence-based approach to creating a dictionary is known as descriptive lexicography. All of our dictionaries describe the way languages are and have been used by people around the world, rather than attempting to prescribe the way a language should be used.
 
We apply stringent quality checks to all dictionaries produced or acquired by our expert team so our users can feel confident in our ability to accurately and meaningfully represent each language.</div>
